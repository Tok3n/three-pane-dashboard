# Dashbaord Prototype

## TODO
* "Models", "Collections", and "Views" are constructed willy-nilly with Mustache and jQuery. We'll use Backbone or another framework eventually, but shouldn't invest time in that until we move a little further.

* Add the user info/branding bar at the top.

* Add "Create New" views for each model type.
